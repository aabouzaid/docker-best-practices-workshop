# Docker Best Practices Workshop

In a hands-on approach, we will cover 18 best practices in 4 categories or in other words **‚úÖÔ∏è Dos & üö´ Don'ts**.

Please note, this workshop assumes that you have a basic knowledge of Docker.

For the slides and recording: [Docker Best Practices Workshop](https://tech.aabouzaid.com/2021/09/docker-best-practices-workshop-presentation.html).


## The Application

The application source code is copied from [Docker Sample Application](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/)

It's a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js, however, no real JavaScript experience is needed.
We will just run it.


## The Goal

Review the application [Dockerfile](./app/Dockerfile) and update it with the best practices
according to what we have in the first part of the workshop.

Build:
```
docker build . -t docker-sample-app:v1
```

Run:
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 docker-sample-app:v1
```
