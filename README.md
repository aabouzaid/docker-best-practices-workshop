# Docker Best Practices Workshop

In a hands-on approach, we will cover 18 best practices in 4 categories or in other words **‚úÖÔ∏è Dos & üö´ Don'ts**.

Please note, this workshop assumes that you have a basic knowledge of Docker.

For the slides and recording: [Docker Best Practices Workshop](https://tech.aabouzaid.com/2021/09/docker-best-practices-workshop-presentation.html).


## The Application

The application source code is copied from [Docker Sample Application](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/)

It's a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js, however, no real JavaScript experience is needed.
We will just run it.


## The Goal

The [Dockerfile](./app/Dockerfile) is updated it with the best practices.

### Build

Prod image:
```
docker build . -t docker-sample-app:v1 --target=prod
```

Dev image:
```
docker build . -t docker-sample-app:dev-v1 --target=dev
```

Test image:
```
docker build . -t docker-sample-app:test-v1 --target=test
```

### Run
```

```
